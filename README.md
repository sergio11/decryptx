## üîß **Supported Algorithms**  

DecryptX supports a wide range of algorithms, including modern standards and legacy ones often required for specific security assessments:  

### **Modern Algorithms:**  

- **BLAKE2 (`blake2b`, `blake2s`)**  
  Fast and secure, designed to replace SHA-2.  

- **SHA-2 (`sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`)**  
  Widely used in secure protocols like HTTPS and digital signature systems.  

- **SHA-3 (`sha3_224`, `sha3_256`, `sha3_384`, `sha3_512`)**  
  Based on **Keccak**, offering advanced resistance to collision attacks.  

- **RIPEMD-160 (`ripemd160`)**  
  A cryptographic alternative to MD5 and SHA-1, used in blockchain and other environments.  

- **bcrypt**  
  Designed for password protection, with support for scalable cost factors.  

- **scrypt**  
  Resistant to hardware attacks (ASIC), ideal for systems handling sensitive passwords.  

- **argon2**  
  A modern and secure password hashing algorithm, winner of **PHC 2015**.  

### **Legacy Algorithms:**  

- **MD5 (`md5`)**  
  Considered insecure for most modern applications but still required in older systems.  

- **MD4 (`md4`)**  
  Predecessor to MD5, even less secure, occasionally used in very old applications.  

- **SHA-1 Variant (`sha1_v2`)**  
  A custom version of SHA-1, used for specific applications.  

- **CRC32 (`crc32`)**  
  More suited for integrity verification than cryptographic security.

## üìú **Prerequisites**  

Before using **DecryptX**, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- üêç **Python 3.8+**  
  DecryptX requires Python version 3.8 or higher. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- üì¶ **Required Python Libraries**  
  DecryptX utilizes a set of Python libraries for functionality such as cryptographic hashing, password cracking, progress tracking, and ZIP file handling. Below are the required libraries that you need to install:

  - **`bcrypt==4.2.1`**  
    A fast and secure password hashing library used for working with bcrypt hashes, commonly used in modern password storage systems. This library is essential for verifying bcrypt hashed passwords.
  
  - **`tqdm==4.67.1`**  
    A fast, extensible progress bar library for Python. DecryptX uses `tqdm` to display progress bars during cracking operations, making it easier to track the status of hash and ZIP file cracking processes.
  
  - **`passlib==1.7.4`**  
    A comprehensive password hashing library. `Passlib` is used in DecryptX to handle various hashing algorithms, including bcrypt and Argon2, providing secure password hashing capabilities.
  
  - **`colorama==0.4.6`**  
    A cross-platform library to output colored terminal text. This library is used for enhanced logging and error message formatting, making the tool's output more user-friendly and visually appealing.
  
  - **`pyzipper==0.3.6`**  
    A powerful library for reading and writing password-protected ZIP files with support for AES encryption. `pyzipper` enables DecryptX to crack encrypted ZIP files by trying password combinations from a wordlist.
  
  - **`pycryptodome==3.21.0`**  
    A self-contained Python package for cryptographic operations. `pycryptodome` provides support for various legacy hash algorithms like MD4, RIPEMD-160, and others, enabling DecryptX to handle both modern and older hashing methods.
